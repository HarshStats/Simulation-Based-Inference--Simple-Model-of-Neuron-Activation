# SBI Project: Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Neuron Model

This project implements and analyzes the LIF neuron model, simulates data, and uses BayesFlow for parameter inference.

## Structure
- `src/`: Source code for models, data generation, plotting, and inference
- `data/`: Simulated data and parameters
- `results/`: Plots and output
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and reporting

## Getting Started
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Explore the code in `src/` and notebooks in `notebooks/`
3. Run simulations and inference as described in the notebook
